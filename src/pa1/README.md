This directory contains the main scripts for Programming Assignment 1. Each 
file has a variable 'trial' that indicates the set of files to be used. 
Change this variable to read different data sets from cis/data/pa12.

1. expected_em_markers_main.m
Compute the expected positions of the EM markers on the calibration object
using the optical tracker.

2. em_pivot_calibration_main.m
Perform pivot calibration with the EM probe to obtain the position of the 
calibration post relative to the EM base.

3. opt_pivot_calibration_main.m
Perform pivot calibration with the optical probe to obtain the position of 
the calibration post relative to the EM base.
